This is an mbed program to run the MPU9250 and BMP280 sensors using the [nRF52832 Development Board](https://www.tindie.com/products/onehorse/nrf52832-development-board/) available on Tindie.

The program includes simple magnetometer calibration and uses an interrupt-based data ready scheme. Pin assignments for I2C and MPU9250 INT might have to be changed for the particular version of the nRF52 being used.
